# ðŸ“Œ Twitch Pinned Streamers

## ðŸŽ¯ About

This userscript allows you to "pin" Twitch streamers without needing to be logged in. It works by saving your favorite streamers locally so you can easily keep track of them. If you're logged in, it also works alongside Twitch's built-in follow system.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Pin streamers without an account.
- Works even if you're logged in.
- Saves data locally in your browser.
- Import and export your pinned streamers.

## ðŸŽ® How to Use

- A "Pin" button will appear next to the streamer's **Follow** button. Click it to add them to your pinned list.
- Your pinned streamers will be saved locally, so you donâ€™t need an account.
- If you're logged in, it won't interfere with your existing follows.
- You can import and export your pinned list to transfer it between devices.
- To remove a pinned streamer, click the **(X) button** on the left side of the pinned entry.
