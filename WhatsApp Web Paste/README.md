# ⚠️ Deprecated: WhatsApp Web Paste

**Note: This script is no longer needed, as WhatsApp has resolved the bug that previously prevented pasting on the web version. Once you receive the latest update for WhatsApp Web, you'll be able to paste content as usual. Additionally, you can revert `dom.events.asyncClipboard.readText` to its default state of `false`. Thank you for your support.**

## Firefox

Requires `dom.events.asyncClipboard.readText` to be enabled in `about:config`.
