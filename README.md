## 📌 What is a Userscript?

## 🚀 How to Install and Use a Userscript

To use userscripts, you need a browser extension that can manage them. Follow these steps:

### 1️⃣ Install a Userscript Manager

First, install a userscript manager extension for your browser:

- **Chrome / Edge / Brave / Opera** → [Violentmonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag)
- **Firefox** → [Violentmonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/)
- **Safari** → [Tampermonkey](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tampermonkey/id6738342400)

### 2️⃣ Install the Userscript

Once you have a userscript manager installed, follow these steps:

1. Open the **userscript file** or the **raw URL** of the script.
2. Your userscript manager should automatically detect it and show an **"Install"** button.
3. Click **"Install"** to add the script to your manager.

### 3️⃣ Enable & Use the Script

- Make sure the script is **enabled** in the userscript manager.
- Visit the websites where the script is intended to run.
- The script should now be active!

### 4️⃣ Managing Userscripts

- To **enable/disable** a script, use the userscript manager dashboard.
- To **remove** a script, delete it from the manager.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

- **The script isn't working?** Ensure it's enabled and that it's designed for the website you're visiting.
- **Conflicts with other scripts?** Disable other userscripts to check for conflicts.
